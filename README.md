# Personal Project on Sustainability and Research


## Introduction

This website is a personal endeavour to develop my coding skills, as well as explore topics I am passionate about in my personal life. The goal is to gradually merge my personal and professional pursuits into a product that I can be proud to showcase to others. 

## Core Behavior

Insert description about how to use. Insert description about core functionality of the website and what users can find. 
 

## Versioning

I began this project on January 6, 2025. I started by cloning a previous website which I developed in my graduate Web Development course. Although that website is much different in design than my personal blog, I wanted to have a code foundation that I understood, and could then adapt and transform into the product I wanted. The goal of this project is to be consistent; as long as I commit at least a few hours a week to this "hobby", I will continue to learn, improve, and create throughout the process. 

Once I create the base model version for this website, I will begin to elevate the code by learning various frameworks and experiementing with different coding techniques.
